# 📊 Anomaly Detection Project

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project leverages a dataset from [Kaggle's Anomaly Detection Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/anomaly-detection/data?select=Submission.csv) to develop a model for identifying anomalies. **Anomaly detection** is crucial in many fields, including energy management, fraud detection, and system monitoring, where it helps detect unusual behaviors early.

### 🎯 Use Case Example: Energy Consumption in London
Applying anomaly detection to London’s energy data enables the identification of unusual usage patterns, such as sudden spikes or unexpected drops. Detecting these irregularities helps in identifying equipment malfunctions, unauthorized usage, and other unusual activities that may require further investigation.

## 📂 Dataset Overview

### 1. **Description**
   - **Content**: Each entry represents a data point with multiple features, with anomalies embedded to help build robust detection models.
   - **Normal Entries**: Expected, typical data points.
   - **Anomalies**: Outliers that deviate from the norm, potentially indicating abnormal activities or data errors.

### 2. **Features**
   - **Timestamp**: Recorded date and time of the data point.
   - **Feature Set**: Data includes several features (e.g., energy metrics, user demographics) providing a detailed snapshot per entry.

### 3. **Anomaly Representation**
   - **Definition**: Anomalies represent data points that do not fit expected patterns and may indicate errors, unusual usage, or rare events that could be of interest.

## 📊 Dataset Statistics

- **Total Entries**: X (Total rows in the dataset)
- **Anomaly Percentage**: Y% flagged as anomalies, showing the ratio of outliers to total entries
- **Feature Breakdown**:
  - **Averages**: Mean and standard deviation for continuous features
  - **Anomaly Distribution**: Anomalies per feature (if applicable), showing which features have the highest rates of anomalies.
