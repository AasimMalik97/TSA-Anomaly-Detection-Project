Use Case: This dataset could be used for a variety of real-world anomaly detection applications, such as monitoring energy consumption for urban residents. Anomaly detection in this context helps identify unusual patterns, like significant spikes or drops in consumption, which could signal issues like faulty equipment, tampering, or unexpected usage patterns.

Dataset Description: The dataset is structured to capture normal and anomalous patterns within a particular context (e.g., energy usage, financial transactions, etc.). Each row represents a data point across multiple features, which describe specific attributes or measurements of the observed phenomenon. Anomalies in the dataset are instances that deviate from established norms, representing unexpected behavior or outliers that need to be flagged.

Features: Typical features may include time-series data points, values representing certain measurements, or categorical identifiers. In the case of energy data, features might include timestamps, hourly or daily energy consumption, location identifiers, and possibly weather conditions or holiday markers.

Statistics: Key statistics to extract include the percentage of anomalies within the dataset, distributions of values for major features, mean and standard deviation for continuous features, and count or proportion for categorical features. Typically, anomaly datasets have a small percentage of anomalies (often below 10%) to mimic real-world conditions where abnormal events are rare.
