Anomaly Detection Dataset - Project Documentation
Project Overview
This project focuses on anomaly detection using a dataset sourced from Kaggle's anomaly detection competition. Anomaly detection is a critical component in monitoring systems, where identifying unusual behavior or "outliers" enables early detection of potential issues. This dataset, combined with robust machine learning models, is ideal for scenarios such as identifying irregular energy consumption patterns, fraud detection, and system diagnostics.

Use Case
The dataset can be applied to detect anomalies in energy consumption data for London residents. Detecting anomalies in energy data can reveal irregularities, such as sudden spikes or drops in usage, which may indicate faulty equipment, unauthorized access, or other unusual behaviors. The project aims to identify these outliers to support proactive management and corrective actions.

Dataset Description
This dataset comprises time-series and/or feature-based data points, including both normal and anomalous entries:

Normal Entries: Represent typical data points that conform to established patterns within the dataset.
Anomalies: Indicate data points that deviate from the norm, which could signal rare or unexpected events. Anomalies might represent abnormal user behavior, equipment failures, or data errors.
Features
Timestamp: Date and time of the recorded data point.
Feature 1, Feature 2, â€¦ Feature N: Variables that represent different measurements or characteristics associated with each data point.
The dataset is structured so that each row represents a unique data entry, where a combination of feature values determines if the point is normal or anomalous.

Dataset Statistics
Based on an initial analysis:

Total Data Points: X (total count of records)
Percentage of Anomalies: Y% (anomalies within the dataset)
Feature Averages: Mean, median, and standard deviation for key features
Distribution of Anomalies Across Features: Breakdown of how often anomalies occur per feature or category, if applicable
This dataset provides a balanced foundation for training models, assessing performance, and identifying potential risks associated with anomalies in real-world applications.
